# Face-Fetch
This is the official code repository associated with our paper titled [**"FaceFetch: An Efficient and Scalable Face-Retrieval System that uses your Visual Memory"**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8919484) which was presented as IEEE BigMultimedia 2020 (BigMM 2020) conference in Singapore.

Our framework is a face-retrieval system that relies only on the slight impressions of the target face of a person the user has envisioned. We do this by searching the target image from a database of faces in a fast, efficient and reliable manner.

The step-by-step instructions to run the FaceFetch webapp are written in the README file within the `app` folder.
